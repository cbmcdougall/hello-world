Hey there!

I'm Calum, an astrophysics graduate with experience in making numerical simulations and carrying out data analysis in python, wolfram mathematica, and ye olde fortran90.

Coding was something I enjoyed a bunch at uni, and i'm keen to learn more. I have touched upon some basic HTML, CSS, and JS and i'm enrolled in a training course in full-stack engineering at Futureproof to learn more.

In my free time I enjoy playing games, listening to and playing music (in particular I have recently been learning guitar), and occasionally drawing :)
